# How it's made
Made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Much of the layout was made using flexbox. The fonts and logos are imported using Google Fonts and Font-awesome, respectively. 
Javascript is used to help make the site responsive, such as the navagation menu switching to a button at the top on smaller devices.
# Optimizations
The majority of the work for this project is done in CSS. I found flexbox to be the best way to make the page responsive using media queries at sizes where elements
began to get crowded. The hours listed vertically on the top div could have been added to the background image, but I figured that would make it difficult in case
the hours changed. While creating a style for these hours was difficult to keep in the right place when the screen-size changes, I think this dynamic method is
better for the client.
# What I have learned
This project is one of my first. it was a real challenge to get the layout correct. I learned a great deal about the best way to organize the HTML so elements work
better with flexbox. Futher work needs to be done to make the site look better on a phone. Also, I will be adding more to the gallery so that thumbnails enlarge on
hover and users can click on the images to show them at full resolution.
